## Application source and feature progress

The [app workspace](app/README.md) contains the SDK, frontend and independent API-compatible backend. [PRD](app/PRD.md) · [Detailed ledger](app/contracts/feature-progress.json) · [Validation](app/evidence/validation.json).

| Source / evidence measure | Complete / inventoried | Progress | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Published SDK source | 31 / 31 files | 100% | Exact npm 4.3.1 source bytes; full behavior parity still unqualified |
| Frontend JavaScript capture | 648 / 648 scripts | 100% | Known scripts in the captured route/asset graph only |
| Frontend factory extraction | 4915 / 4915 inventoried variants | 100% | Extracted factories, not original source files; authenticated/unseen modules unknown |
| Public developer API contract | 67 / 67 documented operations | 100% | Specification captured; native compatibility 0 / 67 (0%) |
| Original backend source | Not observable | N/A | Implement replacement behavior from API evidence |
